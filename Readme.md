#Yoman WebApp boilerplate code
To quickly scaffold a Web App I will be using [Yoman](http://yeoman.io/). It is dependent on Node.js and npm, also a couple of npm generators.

##Runnnign the project

To get things going:

* Install [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
* Install [Bower](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower) ```$ install -g bower```
* Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) ```$ npm install -g grunt-cli```

Once complete should be able to run common Grunt tasks from the Terminal/Command line.

* ```cd ``` to the root directory and
* Install dependencies by running
```$ npm install```

* To run the example locally in a browser:
```$ grunt serve```

You should by now have the Application running in a Browser.

* Run the tests: ``` $ grunt test```
