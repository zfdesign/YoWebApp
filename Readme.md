#Yoman WebApp boilerplate code
To quickly scaffold a Web App I will be using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). It is dependent on [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/), [npm]() and a couple of npm generators.

This is a copy of the [Yeoman Web App generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) with some small modifications. 
* It is using Jasmine as a test runner.

##Runnnign the project

To get things going:

* Navigate to a suitable location in Terminal/Command line or your tool of choice
* Clone this repository ```$ git clone https://github.com/zfdesign/YoWebApp.git```
* Install [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
* Install [Bower](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower) ```$ install -g bower```
* Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) ```$ npm install -g grunt-cli```

Once complete should be able to run common Grunt tasks from the Terminal/Command line.

* ```cd ``` to the root directory and
* Install dependencies by running ```$ npm install```

* To run the example locally in a browser: ```$ grunt serve```

You should by now have the Application running in a Browser.

* Run the tests: ``` $ grunt test```
